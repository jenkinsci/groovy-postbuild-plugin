    This option defines whether a job configurator is allowed to access to internal objects ('hudson', 'build', 'listener') within the groovy postbuild scripts. <br />
    In a shared secure environment an administrator might want to enable this option to ensure a consistent security policy. 
    <p>
    Access to manger is still allowed, therefore all the convenient methods are open for use.
